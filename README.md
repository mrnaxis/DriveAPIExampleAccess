# Drive API Example

It's a dumb, but functional example using Google.APIs.v3 for .NET

Needs some configuration to work (like some variables need to be inserted in the app.config file). For helping with it I'll put some hints and links.

I would like to thank some people who gave snippets, hints, etc that help me create this simple example. Hope one day I can improve it.

Any tip or comment you can give, feel free to do it. It's not in the best shape or represent good programming practices, I still have a lot to learn so anything that may improve or give some hint/tip I'll be glad to hear =).
